# PUBG-Battletracker
This project uses the oficial PUBG API to retrieve and show player data in a good manner by simply entering your PUBG in-game name.

Keep in mind the PUBG API Key that was provided to me has only a RPM limit of 10, each time you search for a player it uses 4 of them, so if you get a 429 error, give it a minute and try again!
